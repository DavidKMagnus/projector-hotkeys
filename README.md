# OBS Projector Hotkeys
Allows the setting of hotkeys to open fullscreen projectors in OBS, and for projectors to be opened to specific windows on startup.

## Limitations
- Due to the limitations of the OBS frontend API, projectors can only be opened and not closed
- Only fullscreen projectors are currently supported
- If the name of a scene changes, the hotkey for that scene will need to be reset

## Configuration

Hotkeys will be avaiable in OBS settings for the Program output and for each scene.
